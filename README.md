# About Github Live Search

Github Live search is a simple tool for searching Github users, their repositories and their followers.
The results are rendered in real time on every key stroke.
With this tool, you are able to quickly search a valid user by Github login.
You can also use this to quickly check whether a Github username you intend to use is already taken.

# The Technology and Limitations

This repo holds the github live search project bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The semantic-ui-react library is used for the user interface and react-router for basic routing.
This App is not limited to a particular operating system as long as the system supports the use of the node package manager (npm).

## Getting started

Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/dhotim/github-live-search.git`

Install the dependencies:
`npm install`

**PS:** If you don't have `npm` installed, check out this guide https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

Finally, start the party:
`npm start`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
